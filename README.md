"This file contains a description of all the files made during the data processing"

"Here is the description of the "Maize" files":

Maize_data.txt: file contains all that data for the maize group; the major files to focus on under this file are Maize_increasingorder.txt and Maize_decreasingorder.txt
Maize_increasingorder.txt: file contains 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values; 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome and 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome
Maize_decreasingorder.txt: file contains 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values; Maize_allhyphen.txt is the file that contains all chromosome data, but their symbol changed to hyphen; Maize_decreasingall10.txt file is a rearrangement file that includes all chromosome data but in a decreasing order

"Here is a description of the "Teosinte" files":

Teosinte_data.txt: file contains all that data for the maize group; the major files to focus on under this file are Teosinte_increasingorder.txt and Teosinte_decreasingorder.txt
Teosinte_increasingorder.txt: file contains 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values; 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome and 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome
Teosinte_decreasingorder.txt: file contains 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values; Teosinte_allhyphen.txt is the file that contains all chromosome data, but their symbol changed to hyphen; Teosinte_decreasingall10.txt file is a rearrangement file that includes all chromosome data but in a decreasing order
